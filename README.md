# 🎓 LearnAble  
### Game-Based Cognitive Assessment Platform for Children

---

## About the Project
**LearnAble** is a game-based cognitive assessment platform designed to understand learning patterns in children through interactive and stress-free activities. Instead of traditional tests, children play simple games while the system analyzes performance to generate meaningful learning insights.

The platform helps caregivers and learning managers make informed decisions by identifying strengths and areas that may need attention at an early stage.

## Problem Statement
Traditional learning assessments for children are often:
- Stressful and non-engaging  
- Difficult to interpret for non-experts  
- Not accessible for early-age evaluation  

There is a need for a child-friendly, data-driven system that can assess cognitive abilities naturally and provide understandable insights.

## Solution
LearnAble solves this by:
- Using **interactive games** instead of exams  
- Collecting performance data in the background  
- Generating **structured learning reports**  
- Presenting insights in a clear, non-technical way  

This makes assessment engaging for children and useful for adults managing learning progress.
